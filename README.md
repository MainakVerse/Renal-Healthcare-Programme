Kidney disease is a chronic (long-lasting) health condition that affects how well your kidneys filter waste and excess fluids from your blood.
There isnâ€™t a complete cure yet for kidney disease, but maintaining a healthy lifestyle, eating a balanced diet, staying hydrated, and managing underlying conditions like diabetes and high blood pressure can help slow its progression. This Web app will help you predict whether a person has kidney disease or is at risk of developing it in the future by analyzing several health parameters using the Random Forest Classifier.
